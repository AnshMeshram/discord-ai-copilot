# Discord AI Copilot (App)

This is the Next.js frontend for the Discord AI Copilot project. All app code, configuration, and dependencies are now inside the `app/` directory for Vercel deployment.

## Structure

- `page.tsx` — main entry point
- `next.config.js`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` — all config files are now in `app/`

## Deployment

Set the Vercel root directory to `app/` in your project settings.
